## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

Data scientists usually have a bachelor's or higher degree. The occupation is expected to grow 36% in the next 10 years, which is very fast.

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

Intro to Data Science - I learned how to use the R programming language to manipulate large datasets. I gained experience in creating data tables, performing analyses on datasets, and creating professional reports with charts, graphs, maps, and interactive apps used to explore data.

3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

Currently, I'm interested in the prospect of going into genetics research (on what topic specifically, I have no idea). Having experience in R can help organize and analyze genetic data, and it also opens up my possibilities to do other things if I choose to alter my career path.

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

The most difficult thing so far has been building Shiny apps. It's a useful skill but the syntax and rules to building a Shiny app are very different than other things in R. The most rewarding thing has been seeing the reports that look all pretty and fancy.

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I wish I had a bit more background in compsci theory so that I could understand exactly why certain things in R behave the way they do. It's not strictly necessary just for me to learn what's taught in the class, but it would deepen my understanding a bit.

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

I'd have liked to learn more about the other features of RStudio and documents besides R Markdown. I still have no idea what a .md file actually does. I've noticed that there are options when creating a document to instead create a Shiny app or to create a presentation, and these have caught my interest a bit.

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to pursue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

I do find coding somewhat fun, but I don't think I'd go in-depth into computer science as a career. I can definitely think of a few uses for the R skills I've learned already, both in my personal life and for my career, and I might learn more about tools/scripts and simple automation with code in the future.

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

Working with others definitely has helped me in this class. To be honest, I don't think transitioning to an online format would be particularly hard for this class (although I do like in-person classes more in general). I do think that it would be harder on occasions when I struggle with a certain problem or subject to not have anyone nearby to turn to and ask for help. I especially think that collaboration during the midterms would be harder online.

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

I didn't yet, but I will remember to.
